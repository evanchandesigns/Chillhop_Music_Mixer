### Notes :memo:

#### Designer Notes:
- Sketch style is created to have soft strokes, which is suitable for Chillhop, allows users to feel focused.
- Concept focuses on fun elements that revolve around a caf√©: desserts, drinks, etc.
- Firstly, gathering inspirations for items, images, character's position.
- Sketch on paper, then scan it to computer and finish with Adobe Illustrator.
- Create a suitable banner for Readme.

#### Developer Notes:
- Plan out the whole layout of the page by building a scaffold.
- Select suitable fonts for concept.
- Start setting divs, classes, and ids.
- Utilizing flexbox functions to hold positions for headings and containers for items.
- Positioning images of items onto tables, classes for items should be set as well.
- Starting Javascript: setting up variables, create functions to add effects after dropped.
- Setting up Drag - Drop and Swappable functions.
- Linking audio files in and allow audios to be Swappable.
- Finishing touches: adding bouncing animation for items after dropped and final debug.

#### Considerations:
- Work more on the UX aspect: creating a function allows items to be dragged back to the original container.
- Creating some more options to allow users to adjust volumes.
